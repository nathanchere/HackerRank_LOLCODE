 The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this

             TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE OF THIS SOFTWARE
 
 This software is dedicated to anyone who believes in challenging the
 machine, sharing knowledge, pushing boundaries, continual improvement,
 transparency, integrity, and freedom of both thought and speech.
 
 It is provided for free (as in beer, speech, hugs, Bird and Willy) on the
 condition that you are not a grub.
 
 If you believe in safe spaces, trigger words, artificial diversity,
 blame anything on a 'patriarchy', consider "mansplaining" or "cisgender"
 to be real words, or have ever instructed someone to "check their
 privilege" with a straight face - you are a grub. You are not granted
 permission to use this software in any way whatsoever.
 
 Should you at any point in the future be determined by the software's
 author to in fact be a grub - such as by pushing your personal political
 agenda on tech conferences - your license is automatically revoked.
 
 The underlying source code is freely available under essentially the
 same terms as the MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
 subject to the additional restrictions for grubs as mentioned above.

 LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
 FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS
